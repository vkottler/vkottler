## Python Projects

Packages I've created are derived from
[python-package-template](https://github.com/{{me["username"]}}/python-package-template),
a custom [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template.
A project template (that leverages a
[config](https://github.com/vkottler/config) repository to keep templates
synchronized in the long-term) makes it easier to start writing code as a next
step immediately after justifying a new project.

See also: [generated documentation](https://{{me["username"]}}.github.io/python/pydoc/)
(created with [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html)).
Information about each project can be found on that project's `README.md`
linked below.
